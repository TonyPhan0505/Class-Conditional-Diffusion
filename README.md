# Class-Conditional-Diffusion
A Machine Learning model to generate images of fashion items given their categories.

This model is trained on the FashionMNIST dataset with 60,000 images and 10 classes, where each class is a type of clothes (e.g. T-shirts, dresses, ...).

Tell this model the type of clothes for which it needs to generate images and it will do it for you.

### Accuracy: 82%
